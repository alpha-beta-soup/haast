                                and to report on the prospects for German emigration. Haast was fluent in English. Haast's eventual report was not favourable for the prospects of emigration, citing the young nation's financial difficulties, and hostilities between immigrants and
                                Māori.

                        <h3>Criticisms of Haast</h3>
                        <p>
                            Haast was ambitious, meticulous, and seemingly obsessed with external recognition for his work: actively seeking personal honours in New Zealand and Europe. His reports were voluminous and extremely detailed—adjectives which were used in a
                            disparaging light.
